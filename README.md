# Template: Python - Assistant AI Chat

This template leverages the new [Python framework](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp), the [libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp/blob/master/docs/README.md#python-libraries) from to same project as well.

The template provides you with the basic structure of an Assistant project: a chat interface that allows the user to communicate with a GPT model. The environment contains the most used libraries, so you do not have to start thinking about those right away.

The template shows you how to use Robocorp Vault for your secrets and how to create robots that interact with humans and AI models, in this case OpenAI's GPT.

## Requirements

To get the Assistant running, you will need an Open AI API key in the Control Room Vault.
Firstly, follow the [Open AI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/build-your-application) to generate an API key and copy it's value.
Then go to Control Room and create a new Vault Secret as desribed in [Our Guide](https://robocorp.com/docs/development-guide/variables-and-secrets/vault).
The Secret name will be `openai` and the key will be `key`.


👉 Other templates are available as well via our tooling and on our [Portal](https://robocorp.com/portal/tag/template)

## Running

#### VS Code
1. Get [Robocorp Code](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features) -extension for VS Code.
1. You'll get an easy-to-use side panel and powerful command-palette commands for running, debugging, code completion, docs, etc.

#### Command line

1. [Get RCC](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)
1. Use the command: `rcc run`

## Results

🚀 After running the bot, check out the `log.html` under the `output` -folder.

## Dependencies

We strongly recommend getting familiar with adding your dependencies in [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) to control your Python dependencies and the whole Python environment for your automation.

  <summary>🙋‍♂️ "Why not just pip install...?"</summary>

Think of [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) as an equivalent of the requirements.txt, but much better. 👩‍💻 With `conda.yaml`, you are not just controlling your PyPI dependencies; you control the complete Python environment, which makes things repeatable and easy.

👉 You will probably need to run your code on another machine quite soon, so by using `conda.yaml`:
- You can avoid `Works on my machine` -cases
- You do not need to manage Python installations on all the machines
- You can control exactly which version of Python your automation will run on 
  - You'll also control the pip version to avoid dep. resolution changes
- No need for venv, pyenv, ... tooling and knowledge sharing inside your team.
- Define dependencies in conda.yaml, let our tooling do the heavy lifting.
- You get all the content of [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) without any extra tooling

## What now?

🚀 Now, go get'em

Start writing Python and remember that the AI/LLM's out there are getting really good and creating Python code specifically.
